# React Project

This is a React project that provides a modern web application. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

Install the project dependencies (this only needs to be done once unless new dependencies are added):

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the development server

To start the development server and work on the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the project.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build will be generated in the `dist` folder by default.


## Project Structure

```plaintext
src/               # Source code of the application
dist/              # Production build output (generated after running `npm run build`)
package.json       # Project configuration and dependencies
README.md          # Project documentation
```
